NYC Taxi Pickup Clustering Analysis====================================This project performs clustering on New York City taxi pickup data using Apache Spark and the K-Means algorithm. The goal is to analyze spatial patterns in pickup locations and extract statistics such as average fare and trip distance for each cluster.Overview:This PySpark script:- Loads and cleans NYC taxi trip data- Filters out invalid or corrupt records- Constructs feature vectors from pickup coordinates- Applies K-Means clustering- Evaluates clustering results using Silhouette score- Summarizes statistics per clusterFeatures:- Data Cleaning & Validation- Feature Engineering with VectorAssembler- Clustering using pyspark.ml.clustering.KMeans- Model Evaluation with Silhouette Score and WSSSE- Cluster Analysis & Summary StatisticsRequirements:- Python 3.x- Apache Spark 3.x- PySpark (install via `pip install pyspark`)- NYC Taxi CSV dataset (must have 17 columns)Setup:1. Save the script to a file (e.g., `taxi_clustering.py`)2. Ensure Apache Spark is installed and configured3. Place your input CSV file (e.g., `yellow_tripdata_2023-01.csv`) in the working directoryUsage:Run the script from the terminal:    spark-Submit taxi_clustering.py path/to/your/input_file.csvExample:    spark-Submit Taxi_Cluster_Proj_1.py taxi-data-sorted-small.csvThe script will output:- Count of valid rows- Pickup coordinate statistics- Cluster centers (longitude/latitude)- Sample predictions- Cluster-wise fare and distance stats- Silhouette Score and WSSSEData Cleaning Rules:Only rows meeting the following criteria are kept:- All necessary fields are valid floats (`fare`, `trip_distance`, `pickup_longitude`, `pickup_latitude`, `total_amount`)- fare > 0, trip_distance > 0, total_amount > 0, tip >= 0- Pickup coordinates within NYC bounds:    - Longitude: -74.5 to -73.5    - Latitude: 40.4 to 41.0Clustering Details:- Features: Pickup Longitude and Latitude- Algorithm: KMeans- Number of Clusters (k): 19- Train/Test Split: 80% / 20%- Evaluation Metrics:    - Silhouette Score    - Within Set Sum of Squared Errors (WSSSE)Output:- Cluster centers with geographic coordinates- Sample of clustered pickup points- Cluster statistics:    - Number of pickups    - Average fare    - Average trip distanceNotes:- You can modify the value of `k` to test different cluster sizes.- Consider visualizing cluster centers using mapping tools.- The CSV file must use the standard NYC taxi trip format (17 columns).
